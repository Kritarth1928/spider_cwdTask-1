(Following the subtasks which are incorporated in this project)

BASIC MODE:
1. The Website should contain the three essential components – a calendar
   to select any particular date of choice, a clock showing the current time
   and a To-do list with the set of tasks for each day.
2. Users should be able to create and delete any tasks in the list.
3. The tasks, along with the date on which they are planned, should be
   stored in the browser's Local Storage.
4. The Clock should be a digital clock with the current time correctly
   displayed. The styling of the Clock should be done using HTML and CSS
   only.
5. The task would be evaluated based on the students' creativity, website UI
   design, and the application's overall functioning.

HACKER MODE:
1. Add an option to view the Clock in either analog or digital format. The
   Analog clock should be shaped like a circle, and all the numbers should
   be aligned appropriately. Only HTML and CSS should be used for the
   styling of the Clock.

GIT:
1. Use git bash or command-line interface instead of git website for making
   commits.
2. Work on a new repository for the project.
3. Include meaningful commit messages for each commit made in the
   repository
4. For the basic task work on the main branch.
5. Once done with the basic task, create a separate branch called hacker
   mode from the main branch and continue working on that branch.
6. Have a proper Readme consisting of the given sub-tasks as a checklist
   and update them accordingly.
